## TLL ~ Today Looks Like..

---
### How was your day?
Track multiple aspects of your life in one app. See the effects that one aspect's changes has on the other areas of your life via some fancy graphs (they're not there yet, but I promise they will be).

### Roadmap
I don't have a concrete plan in place for this app, but some things have been rolling around in my head. Here's a non-conclusive list:
- implementing some kind of user/auth + login system
- including Mongodb and storing long-term data
- making graphs etc. from user-generated data, possibly with https://dmtrbrl.github.io/vue-trend-chart/
